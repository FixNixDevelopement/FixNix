Branch naming conventions
-------------------------

GRC has 3 primary workflow branches:

- `master` is for most development activity
- `canary` is for "release candidates" and should only receive fixes for bugs considered to be "blocking" a production release
- `prod` reflects the current production deployment

There is also `design` branch, which can be used for upcoming or proof-of-concept changes to the UI.

Finally, "feature" branches can be used any time a change may take a significant amount of time or require temporarily breaking functionality.  Feature branches should use the `feature/upcoming-neat-thing` naming convention.
